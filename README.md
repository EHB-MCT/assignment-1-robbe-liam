# About 

This project serves as a versatile startup template designed to help developers kickstart their own Unity projects, including but not limited to 3D platformers, puzzle games, and adventure titles. By providing a solid foundation of essential components and code structures, this startup project aims to reduce the setup time and allow developers to focus on building game-specific mechanics.

### Key Features

- **Singleton Managers** for handling settings, audio, and game states across scenes.
- **Basic Character Controllers** optimized for 3D platformers.
- **Sample Level Setup** with scalable platforms, basic animations, and environment assets.
- **Modular Code Structure** that encourages easy modification and expansion.

Whether you are an indie developer prototyping a new game idea or an experienced developer looking to speed up your workflow, this startup template can help you get from idea to development faster.
